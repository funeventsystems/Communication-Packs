# Communication-Packs

Why are communication systems like Clear-Com and porta-com so expensive?
Does communication really have to be that expensive?
Why are cords still used? Its 2023 right?

--
Communication between backstage and techs is expensive, but what if it doesn't have to be?

Some possible solutions to this project are:
- Walkie talkies, Doesn't interface with computers very well.
- Clear-com, too expensive.

Now there is two choices.
1. Wired
2. Wireless


Wired - A microphone wired to one cable in an ethernet cable, and the speaker to the other, which then goes into an amplifier which connects the mic to the headset, this is just a basic implementation of this system.
Wireless - An ESP8266 based board such as the wemos d1 mini, which has a single analogue in for the microphone and digital outs for the headsets, this would be very easy because the current light systems also use wemos d1 minis.
